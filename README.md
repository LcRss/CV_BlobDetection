# CV_BlobDetection

In many situations there is the need for counting the amount of people entering or exiting from an area (e.g., a shop, a theater, a crowded plaza, etcâ€¦). 
This can be solved using only color data or also 3D information.

This is a simple computer vision application that takes in input a color image together with the corresponding depth map
and is able to count the number of people in the scene.
